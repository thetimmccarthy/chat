# chat
A web-based messaging app built using Node, Express, and Socket.io. It uses a postgres database and the front end is build using handblebars templating. 

Excited to continue building this out. Some additional ideas I plan to implement include:
- User profiles
- multiple chat rooms
- ability to create a chat room and share invites via url
